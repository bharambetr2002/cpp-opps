# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Introduction
OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while **object-oriented programming** is about creating objects that contain both **data and functions**.

### Advantages of OOP over Procedural Programming:
- OOP is **faster and easier** to execute.
- OOP provides a **clear structure** for programs.
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code **DRY** ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), making the code easier to **maintain, modify, and debug**.
- OOP allows the creation of **fully reusable applications** with less code and shorter development time.

## Classes and Objects
Classes and objects are the two main **aspects** of object-oriented programming.

- **Class**: A blueprint or **template** for objects.
- **Object**: An **instance** of a class.

### Example:
Everything in C++ is associated with **classes and objects**, along with their **attributes and methods**.

For example, in real life, a **car** is an object. A car has:
- **Attributes** (e.g., weight, color).
- **Methods** (e.g., drive, brake).

**Attributes and methods** are basically **variables and functions** that belong to the class. These are often referred to as **"class members"**.

## Class Methods
Methods are **functions that belong to a class**.

### Types of Class Methods:
- **Inside Class Definition**
- **Outside Class Definition**
